Redhat Certified System Administration is an entry level exam that Redhat offers to validate your Linux skills. Though it is an entry level exam it is not easy. It is a practical exam and not theoretical. You actually have to execute the tasks. Duration of the exam is three hours long and you are allowed one break. I have recently cleared the exam and I would like to share some tips that helped me in clearing it. 




## Practice

Seems predictable and obvious but believe me when I say that practice is what will get you through. The reason why this is extremely important is because of the time limit of the exam. Generally speaking the tasks given to you in the exam can be completed in a day but to complete them in 3 hours requires speed and efficiency. These qualities are built with practice. A good thumb rule for you should be to complete your sample exams in 2:30 hrs. You might come across people who have completed the RHCSA in an hour and a half and you might be inclined to believe that you could do it too. But when something does not work out in the exam and you have to trouble shoot it you need to be very sure of the root cause and how to fix it else you will end up wasting time. So please practice to the point that you can be woken up in the middle of the night and you could clear the exam.


## Schedule Your Exam Only When You Are Ready

This is an important point to consider. One might be inclined to believe that one can finish the syllabus by the date of the exam. That ways there is a deadline. Please do not do it. I am speaking from personal experience. It is not a good move. Schedule your exam only when you know that you are ready. This way you remove any additional anxiety that could come your way. You would be in a more relaxed state of mind on the day of the exam.


## Troubleshoot Services Before your exam.

Things can go wrong in the exam. A service might not start, a file system might not mount. It can happen. It's best to practice trouble shooting while studying for the exam. What i would suggest is to purposely make some mistakes and see what errors does the system give you. You will be able to understand how the service works. It will force you to read the man pages. So when and if things do go wrong in the exam, it does not stress you out and you know where to look and more importantly what to look for. 


## Read All The Questions

Before you begin please read all the questions. Read them slowly and understand what is being asked. Chances are high that some questions might be linked. Identify them so that you do not end up undoing a task and then redoing it again with an added parameter. Please do not skim through the questions. Please read each word and understand them. Also identify the questions that you think are easy and would not require much time. Get them out of the way either in the beginning or save them for later if you want to concentrate on the big guns in the beginning. The choice is yours but you should have at least group the questions in your head so that you have an idea about which ones will be more time consuming.


## Take A Break

There is one break that is allowed in the exam and I highly recommend that you take it. If you think are short of time don't utilize the entire 10 minutes of it maybe just 3 or 4 minutes but please take a break. It will help you increase your focus. Being in front of the screen under duress is not fun, especially if you are not used to it. A break will help you get your focus back. I would also recommend keeping a bottle of water by your side during the exam. Water is magic during stressful times and it will calm you down if you think you are in trouble in the exam.



Among all the tips that I have mentioned I would say that **practice** is the most important one. 

I do hope sincerely that these tips help you and that you achieve your goals in your journey.

And if you do fail in the exam, don't beat yourself up too much. It is not an easy exam, you will just need to prepare harder and you will clear it.
