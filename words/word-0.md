Like many people I too was part of the crowd that was enamoured by the internet and computers. I ended by doing my graduation in Computer Applications. This was a hybrid degree with a mix of Commerce and Computers with _C_ being the main language that was taught in the final year. Along with _C_ I also learnt _HTML_ at the time but did not think much of it. I ended up pursuing a career first in Human Resources and then Marketing. Now, as things stand before me I have decided to jump back into the world of Computers to rebuild my career and here are my 5 reasons why I chose I.T again. 




5. **Continuous Learning:**

While some might treat this point as a negative, I see a positive side to this aspect. One has to keep learning and be open to learning new things in this field. I was studying for my RHCSA exam. It was based on version 7. I failed it and now that I want to retake the exam I have to study for version 8. Quite a few things remain the same but a few important things have been added as well. I do not mind it at all. In fact I am sure there will come a time when 8 will become 9 and so on . Constant change is the name of the game and it will keep you and your brain fresh. Things that are not used frequently over a period of time lose some functionality. It's like when you learn a spoken language. If you do not keep practicing it you will forget it. 



4. **Certification:** 

These can play an important role in not only furthering your career but also getting into the industry. There is a lot of debate on certifications. Some feel it's a waste of money and that work should speak shoudl speak for itself. I feel certifications are great since they validate the skills that you have and can help you in moving jobs or negotiating a better pay for your  next project. Having said that I must inform you that having a certificate is not like  a golden pass. It will help you put your foot in the door and will help you get noticed by your peers but you have to back it up with the knowledge and work. While there are certifications that are available in other industries as well, the I.T industry offers the biggest variety and the largest number possible.

3. **Money:** 

We all have bills to pay and mouths to feed. This is a reality that we all have to face day in and day out. While money cannot be the only reason, it does play a role, sometimes an important one. The I.T industry can be a well paying one if you have the right qualifications and the right work experience. But even if you are a starter it will pay you enough to live a decent lifestyle in any major city in the world. Sure there are no sales bonuses and commissions but then you wont be cold calling either. In most companies there will be a 13th month salary as a bonus and that is sort of an industry standard. 

2. **Travel:**

Working in the I.T industry the world is literally your oyster. You can work in Estonia or in Ecuador or in the Emirates. You don't need to speak the local language. Let the keyboard do your talking.This is a big plus in the I.T world and because of this you will get to meet people from all over the world. This industry is truly an international community. The word *Digital Nomad* sounds familiar to you ? The nomad would have been local if it was not for the word digital.

1. **People:**

The number 1 reason is the people. You will find the most inclusive people here. This industry has led the way in diversity. There is a sense of collaboration and co-operation that you will sense here. Team work makes the dream work. This industry offers the best possible opporunity for you to work with different people from different cultures in different timezones all coming together for one common goal. It's a great feeling. Having said that I must also inform you that this is not an industry of angels. It has it's own battles but also it deals with them in one of the most transparent ways.


These were some of the reasons why I chose I.T .  . again ! I hope they were helpful to you and that you consider them when the time comes for you to decide.
