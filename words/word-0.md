# 5 Reasons Why I Chose I.T . . . Again !

---

Even though I did my graduation in Computers where I learned **C** and **HTML** I did not work in the IT industry. Now as things stand before me I have decided to join the industry.

Here are 5 reasons why I chose IT.



5. **Certification:** 

These can play an important role in not only furthering your career but also more importantly, getting into the industry if you do not have a college degree or experience. There is a lot of debate on certifications. Some feel it's a waste of money and that work should speak should speak for itself. I feel certifications are great since they validate the skills that you have and can help you start your career. Having said that I must inform you that having a certificate is not like having a golden pass. It will help you put your foot in the door and will help you get noticed by your peers but you have to back it up with the knowledge and work. While there are certifications that are available in other industries as well, the I.T industry offers the biggest variety and the largest number possible. **Certifications will also help you steer your career in the direction you chose.**


4. **Continuous Learning:**

While some might treat this point as a negative, I see a positive side to this aspect. **One should keep learning and be open to learning new things in life.** I was studying for my RHCSA exam. It was based on version 7. I failed it and now that I want to retake the exam I have to study for version 8. Quite a few things remain the same but a few important things have been added as well. I do not mind it at all. In fact I am sure there will come a time when 8 will become 9 and so on . Constant change is the name of the game and it will keep you and your brain fresh. Things that are not used frequently over a period of time lose some functionality. It's like when you learn a spoken language. If you do not keep practicing it you will forget it. 


3. **Money:** 

We all have bills to pay. This is a reality that we all have to face day in and day out. While money cannot be the only reason, it does play a role, sometimes an important one. The I.T industry can be a well paying one if you have the right qualifications and the right work experience. But even if you are a starter it will pay you enough to live a decent life in any major city in the world. Sure there are no sales bonuses and commissions but then you wont be cold calling either. In most companies there will be a 13th month salary as a bonus while others might have quarterly bonuses linked to your performance. _While this is not the most important factor, it is one worth considering._


2. **Travel:**

Working in the I.T industry the world is literally your oyster. You can work in Estonia or in Ecuador or in the Emirates. You don't need to speak the local language. Let your technical knowledge do the talking. The word *Digital Nomad* sounds familiar to you ? The nomad would have been local if it was not for the word digital. In the I.T world  you will get to meet people from all over the world. This industry is truly an international community which leads me to the number one reason . . . 

1. **People:**

The number 1 reason is the people. You will find the most inclusive set of people here. This industry has led the way in diversity. There is a sense of collaboration and co-operation that you will sense here. **Team work makes the dream work.** This industry offers the best possible opportunity for you to work with different people from different cultures in different time zones all coming together for one common goal. It's a great feeling. Having said that I must also inform you that this is not an industry of angels. It has it's own battles but also it deals with them in one of the most transparent ways.

### One more reason

While these are all the reasons that helped me form my decision, there is one more reason which outweighed all the others. That reason is that **I like this and I want to do this.** 


I simply cannot stress enough how important this factor is.

When push comes to shove and when you face failures, this reason will be your only guiding light to keep moving ahead and to keep trying. Failure is inevitable, what matters is how we react to it.

These were some of the reasons why I chose I.T .  . again ! I hope they were helpful to you and that you consider them when the time comes for you to decide.
